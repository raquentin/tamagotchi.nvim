- **Lucy**: a star and mascot of the [Gleam programming language](https://gleam.run/) (faster decay, food-focused)
- **Churro**: a dog (moderate decay, mood-focused)
- **Bunny**: a bunny (active, high satiety needs)
- **Dragon**: a dragon (slow decay, hardy)
- **Grizz**: a bear (moderate decay, very hungry)
